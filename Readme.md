# LEMON Homebrew Tap
This is a homebrew tap for the Library for Efficient Modeling and Optimization in Networks, which isn't part of homebrew-core (there's another lemon which is a parser generator).

Useful for installing [OpenROAD](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD), where the dependencies would become a one-liner:

```
brew install bison boost cmake donn/lemon-graph/lemon-graph eigen flex git libomp ninja pyqt5 python spdlog swig tcl-tk zlib
```

# Usage
`brew install donn/lemon-graph/lemon-graph`

# License
2-clause BSD license. See 'License'.

These formulas are derived from and are enabled by work of the Homebrew team, who we thank dearly.
